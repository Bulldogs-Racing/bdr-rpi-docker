bdr-rpi-docker repository manual
About this repository
This is the documentation for the Github repository called bdr-rpi-docker. It is a Docker environment designed to be integrated with Visual Studios Code for the simulation of the Raspberry Pi environment that the Bulldog’s Racing car operates on. This was designed for development purposes.
Who should use this library?
Anyone who wishes to familiarize themselves with Raspberry Pi and wants the basic file tree there already.
A general knowledge of UNIX is helpful, but not required.
Software requirements
The only limitations here are 1.) storage and 2.) the ability to run Docker. 
Windows Users: please see the windows-release branch on the GitHub page and read THAT documentation instead. This is for MacOS and Linux.
Quickstart 
1)	Navigate to the repository page on Github bdr-rpi-docker. NOTE: you must be on the main branch, NOT the Windows release! See Windows instructions otherwise.
2)	Expand folder, and open in Visual Studios code (download here)
3)	Install Docker/Docker Desktop 
4)	Install the Container tools extension by Microsoft 
5)	In VS Code, press CTRL+SHIFT+P (MAC: CMD+SHIFT+P) and type reopen in container
Theory
What is Docker?
Docker is an open platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications within isolated environments called containers. It achieves this by providing a standardized way to package an application and all its dependencies (libraries, system tools, code, and runtime) into a single, self-contained unit.
